tomato-line
===========

A learning project that uses node to access rotten tomato lists.

This project is of no use to anyone except *me*. I'm using it as a play project for me to learn about:

* Git workflow
* Gulp
* Node
* Request
* Streams
* Async


I'm working on a Git workflow that allows me to work on the project from several
different machines at once. This modification is made via my work machine.
